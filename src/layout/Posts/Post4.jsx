			<Title>Confidential Project #2: Workplace Safety Testing Application</Title>

			<p>
				Last month, I started working on a <span> web app dashboard </span> designed to test
				employees on workplace safety, targeting industrial workers and hands-on engineers.
			</p>

			<p>
				The client needed software with modern technology and scalability, and I was given
				full control over the design, only requiring minimal approvals from the board of
				directors.
			</p>

			<Image src={p42} caption={"Center of Resources for the platform"} />

			<p>
				I began by creating wireframes and HIFI key pages in Figma, focusing on a{" "}
				<span>sleek, modern look.</span> Once approved, I moved to the frontend, developing
				custom components and a robust grid layout system.
			</p>

			<p>
				Result: Sprint reviews have been met with <span> consistent approval</span>. My
				favorite component so far is the table, which supports bulk actions, searching,
				pagination, and filters. Itâ€™s scalable, plug-and-play, and will be reused in future
				projects. Plans are underway to enhance it further with dynamic animations using
				"motion."
